                <h2>Research on Teenagers' Daily Digital Use</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>Research conducted by Duke University, USA has established that too much time spent on technology can negatively affect attention span, fitness levels and behaviour, as children become more and more anxious after using digital devices like smart phones. However, there are also some positive outcomes from this research which is reassuring.</p>
                    
                    <p>The research was published in a special issue of a well-known scientific journal called 'Child Development'. It examined the links between teenagers' mental health and how much time they spent online each day texting, using social media and the Internet.</p>
                    
                    <p>Researchers asked one hundred and fifty-one teenagers to complete a survey on their smartphones about their daily digital use. They were closely observed three times a day for a month, and their mental health was assessed eighteen months later. The participants were between 11 and 15 years of age, were from a lower economic group and were at risk of developing serious mental health problems.</p>
                    
                    <p>The teenagers spent an average of two to three hours a day using various digital devices. More than an hour of that time was spent texting. The students sent on average forty-one texts a day. The researchers found that on days when the volunteers used their devices more often they were more likely to engage in bad behaviour such as lying and fighting. Furthermore, on days when teenagers used their smartphones more frequently, they were sleepy, inattentive in class or hyperactive. These disorders are known as ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) and HAD (Hyper-Activity Disorder).</p>
                    
                    <p>The research also found that young people who spent more time online found it difficult to control their behaviour and emotions. It is unclear whether these symptoms were a direct result of spending too much time online, or if the condition already existed.</p>
                    
                    <p>On a positive note, the researchers discovered that there may be some advantages for those teenagers who suffer from anxiety and depression. The longer they spent texting, the less likely they were to feel depressed or anxious. So, using digital devices may benefit these individuals as they use their smart phones to connect with their peers.</p>
                    
                    <p>It may well be that young people are using digital technology to connect in more positive ways, than previously thought. In the past, some researchers found that teenagers using digital devices were socially isolated. But at that time, only a small number of young people were online unlike today.</p>
                    
                    <p>In conclusion, the teenagers in this research were already at risk of developing serious mental health problems regardless of how much time they spent online. Therefore, it is unclear if the findings discussed above would apply to all teenagers.</p>
