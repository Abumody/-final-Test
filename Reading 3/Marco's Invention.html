                <h2>Marco's Story</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>In Italy during the 19th century, young Marco Astorre lived with his parents. He was deeply curious about his father's work. His father was a talented glassmaker, and Marco enjoyed watching him craft vases and windows, which were often sold to wealthy businessmen.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 1923, at the age of sixteen, Marco left his parents' house to live with his grandmother. He became interested in the way light passed through different pieces of glass. One day, he noticed that when he held up pieces of glass to the sunlight, objects appeared larger than they were in reality. This observation made him think of his grandmother, who struggled to read because of her poor eyesight. Marco wondered if glass could help her see better and began testing the idea of making glass lenses.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the summer of 1924, Marco started his experiments. He gathered small, round pieces of glass and shaped them into different sizes and curves. He tested each piece by holding it over his eye. Some lenses made objects appear smaller and unclear, while others made things bigger but left him feeling dizzy. After ten days, Marco managed to isolate the lenses that made objects look larger.</p>
                    
                    <p>On day 23, he used the lenses to examine the details of paintings in his house, but the images still weren't clear. After 35 days of trial and error, Marco discovered that lenses could make objects appear smaller or larger depending on their shape and thickness. One afternoon in 1925, Marco put the lenses on his eyes and looked out the window. The view wasn't too small or too large, it was just right. He ran excitedly to his grandmother and asked her to try them.</p>
                    
                    <p>When she put them on, she was excited and said: "I can see better, Marco! I can see better."</p>
                    
                    <p>In that moment, he was eager to share his success. He told his friend about the lenses, and when his friend tried them, he was so impressed that he told everyone he met on the street. News of Marco's lenses spread quickly throughout the town. Soon, many old people came to Marco's workshop, hoping he could help them as well.</p>
