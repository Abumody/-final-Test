                    Last summer, we decided to spend our vacation at the beach. The travel agent said that travelling by bus was the cheapest way to get there, but we went by plane because it was faster. The weather on the beach was beautiful and we had a great time.

                    Albert Einstein was born in 1879 in Germany. He was not considered to be particularly smart when he was growing up, so everyone was shocked when he became the most famous scientist in the world. His parents were concerned he would not be successful because he was slow to speak as a child.

                    Tokyo is the capital of Japan. It is a very different place at night to how it is during the day. This is because millions of neon signs are switched on, once it gets dark and the whole city lights up. I think Tokyo is the most exciting and cosmopolitan city in the world.

                    Marie Curie was born in Poland in 1867. Her childhood was not a happy one. Her older sister died when she was nine and her mother died when she was eleven.
