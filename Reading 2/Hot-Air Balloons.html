            <div class="reading-text">
                <p>In 1783, after having spent months designing and building their balloon, two French brothers called Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier wanted to find out if people could fly in it safely. In November of the same year, two volunteers climbed into their invention and went up into the sky above Paris. The crowd below was very excited, but they were also quite scared, especially the women and children who had come to watch. Only two months earlier in September 1783, the first hot-air balloon in history had flown into the sky. On that occasion, its passengers were a duck, a chicken, and a sheep! However, this time the men flew for twenty-five minutes and then landed the balloon safely.</p>
                
                <p>The successful launch of the Montgolfier brothers' hot-air balloon was big news, and soon many other scientists and engineers wanted to design even bigger, and better balloons. Just two years later in 1785, a French balloonist called Blanchard, and his American copilot Jeffries, managed to fly across the English Channel between France and England. It took two and a half hours despite the rain and the freezing cold-wind.</p>
                
                <p>People thought that a new age of international travel was about to start. However, hot-air balloons as a form of transport never became popular. It just cost too much money and was too dangerous. In the nineteenth century, scientists invented other forms of transport such as trains and steamboats. Later after oil was discovered, cars and planes with oil engines were used for travel. No one was really interested in developing hot-air balloons any longer.</p>
                
                <p>But then, in the 1930s, with the introduction of more modern materials, and a different type of gas called helium which meant they could fly for longer distances, a new generation of hot-air balloonists rediscovered the thrills and excitement of ballooning. They flew higher and higher, reaching heights of over twenty-five kilometres above sea level.</p>
                
                <p>In the late 1970's, three American pilots crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a hot-air balloon for the first time. In 1981, four pilots crossed the Pacific Ocean, flying from Japan to California in just under eighty-four hours. Since then, other adventurers have broken even more records. Travelling at speeds of around 400 kms per hour, Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand flew across the Pacific in forty-six hours, and in 1999, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones went all the way around the world in exactly twenty-one days in a balloon.</p>
