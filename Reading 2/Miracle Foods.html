            <div class="reading-text">
                <p>I have always been puzzled with people who spend their time in health shops buying so-called 'miracle food'. I know all about this. My own wife used to be obsessed with such foods, until she was admitted to hospital with an illness caused by one of them.</p>
                
                <p>Just remember what the word actually means. According to the dictionary, a 'miracle' is "an extraordinary event that cannot be explained by natural or scientific laws." So why do intelligent people like my wife believe in 'miracle' food? Is it a deep fear of an illness and death? I don't think so. In my view, they are just looking for a quick, easy, trouble-free way of 'solving' a difficult problem! Of course, the media, especially, the newspaper, play a massive role in encouraging the people to think in this way. Without their constant stories about so-called 'healthy lifestyle', the manufacturers and health shops would not be able to make huge profit.</p>
                
                <p>For years, whenever patient asked me about these foods, I just dismissed them as total waste of time and money. However, after what happened to my wife, I began to take things more seriously. I decided to spend some time doing research in this area. And when I did this, I was really shocked! I found that 'miracle' foods were promoted everywhere, even when there is no scientific evidence at all to support their use.</p>
                
                <p>Let's look at some examples, Coconut oil is, we are told, useful to lose weight, controlling blood sugar and preventing strokes. Apple cider vinegar can help with digestive disorders, sore throat, and even dandruff! Manuko honey- which I must admit does taste delicious- is said to be anti-bacterial, helping with a wide range of infections. Spirulina can overcome cancer as well as mental conditions, like depression. It seems that, there is no disease in the world that cannot be cured by these foods!</p>
                
                <p>I must admit that we doctors are partly to blame, too. We have known about these issues, but focused our attention on new drugs, new operating techniques and so on. We have left the field of diet open to unqualified business agents who spread misleading information. We must now try to communicate with people and tell them the truth about these foods- the especially at there is no such thing as a 'miracle'! The best we can all do is simply to follow a sensible, balanced diet and lifestyle.</p>
